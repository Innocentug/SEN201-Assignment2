# Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
## Project: Student Result Management System

### 1. Requirement Analysis
The Student Result Management System is designed to manage student academic records.
The system allows users to enter student names and scores, automatically calculate grades, and display student results.

### 2. System Design
The system is designed as a console-based application using Python.
It consists of input, processing, and output modules.
Student data is stored temporarily using a list.

### 3. Implementation
The system was implemented using Python programming language.
Functions were created to add student records, calculate grades, and display results.

### 4. Testing
The system was tested with different student scores to ensure accurate grade calculation and correct output display.

### 5. Deployment
The system is deployed by running the Python file on a computer system with Python installed.

### 6. Maintenance
Future improvements may include data storage using files or databases and a graphical user interface.
